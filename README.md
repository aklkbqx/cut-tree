## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Why doesn't the tree break?

A: Check that:

- You're holding an axe (not another tool)
- You're digging up a log/stem, not stripped wood or planks
- **The tree must meet one of the following checks**:
1. Height >= 2 blocks and have >= 3 leaves (normal trees)
2. Leaves >= 10 blocks (large trees)
3. Height >= 5 blocks and have >= 2 leaves (tall trees)
- The tree does not exceed the specified size (default: 5000 blocks)
- **Enable debug mode** to view detailed check information

### Q: Can this be used with wooden structures?

A: **Most don't!** - The datapack has checks to verify that the tree is a real tree:

- Must have the appropriate height and leaves (See criteria above.)
- Structures with no leaves or only 1-2 blocks high ‚Üí Safe and cannot be destroyed
- If accidentally destroyed, adjust the config or lower the max_logs value.

### Q: Does the axe cost money?

A: **Only 10% of the cost is lost!** (v1.1)

- Cut 100 blocks of wood ‚Üí The axe costs only **10 points**
- Netherite axes (2031 durability) can cut **~20,000 blocks**!
- Disable: `/scoreboard players set #config.damage_axe ct.count 0`

### Q: Does it support large jungle trees (2x2)?

A: **Yes!** The datapack will automatically detect and cut down 2x2 trees (Jungle and Dark Oak).

### Q: Can I gather all logs in one place?

A: **Yes! (v2.0)** - Configure with `#config.gather_location`:
- `0` = Off (logs drop normally)
- `1` = Player position (logs teleport to you) - **Recommended!**
- `2` = Tree trunk (logs gather at the base of the tree)

Example: `/scoreboard players set #config.gather_location ct.count 1`

### Q: Does it work in multiplayer?

A: Yes! It works in both single-player and multiplayer.

### Q: Does it support other versions?

A: This datapack is designed for Minecraft 1.21+ (pack_format 48-88, which covers 1.21.x to 1.21.10+).

### Q: What are the sounds when chopping down trees?

A: The datapack automatically uses the vanilla sounds:

- Use the `minecraft:entity.player.attack.strong` sound (the standard strike sound).
- Need a custom sound? See **`SOUND_INFO.md`** (a separate Resource Pack is required).
- Recommended: Edit `break_tree.mcfunction` to use the `minecraft:block.anvil.land` sound instead.
